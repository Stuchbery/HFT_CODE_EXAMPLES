# HFT_CODE_EXAMPLES

Code is based on this white paper, specifically "EXAMPLE 3: ONE-PASS ALGORITHM FOR EXPONENTIALLY WEIGHTED LINEAR REGRESSION"
https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2523426.2534976

The code has been modified to be used as a Multidimensional Exponentially Weighted Linear Regression, with exponential forgetting
It is an online algorithm that can be updated and used with streaming data.
